# Python Queries

This program runs 10 distinct queries from a MySQL database that mimics Steam. The queries are contained in the Reader class. To properly run this, you need to setup a local MySQL server and upload our database which is included in this repository.

To run this application, go to the main folder and type:
```
python main.py
```
Or, if you're using Python 3.x
```
python3 main.py
```
Additional database setup configuration might be needed depending on your network, OS, and general settings.
