# Python Queries

This program runs 10 distinct queries from a MySQL database that mimics Steam. To properly run this application, you need to setup a local MySQL server and upload our "steamdb" database which is included in this repository. The separate files for table creations, inserts, and queries are in the *db* folder.

To run this application you will also need Python and the mysql-connector module.
Go to the main folder and type:
```
python main.py
```
Alternatively, if you're using Python 3.x
```
python3 main.py
```
Additional database setup configuration might be needed depending on your network, OS, and general settings.
